### Why use Nextjs for such a simple website?
Nextjs' scalabilty is not its only advantage, it also has performance, SEO and coding improvements. I'm really used
to it at this point and I see no point in going back to plain React

### Technologies used
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). React framework for SSR and great loading speeds.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/). JS library used, of course.
* [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) I swear to god I'm never letting go of this icon library
